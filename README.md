##  Featured Projects

- **Deep-Learning-Optimised-Metamaterial**  
  Developed acoustic metamaterials via deep learning that can reduce noise by over 80%, while generating power to supply 4,000 families when installed in the London Underground.

- **Mechatronics-Computing-Hydroto**  
  Created an interactive installation that plays kalimba, hand drum, and triangle with raindropsâ€”powered by the Bela platform using C++ for hardware interaction and audio synthesis.

- **Future-Design-Simulating-Oxygen-and-Population-Response-of-Planktons-in-Death-Zone**  
  Simulated aquaculture conditions in West Africa for 2050 using COMSOL Multiphysics, proposing resilient design solutions to counteract increasing dead zones.

- **MD-analysis-of-performance-of-hydrogel-and-complex-material-in-situ-of-bioleaching**  
  Built a multiscale digital twin of a bioleaching systemâ€”studying molecular interactions between hydrogels and metal ions via GROMACS, LAMMPS, and VMD.

- **Applied-Robotics-ROS-system-control**  
  Built a robotic control framework using ROS to coordinate 8-DOF robots through simulation and task execution (Python).

- **Predicting-the-Presence-of-Heart-Disease-based-on-Health-Conditions**  
  Collaborated on a data science project to compare machine learning model performances in predicting heart disease using Jupyter notebooks.
